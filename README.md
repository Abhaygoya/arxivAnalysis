# Arxiv Analysis

Looking into doing some analysis of arxiv papers using the dataset made available by kaggle. To run this code, you'll need to download the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv

Building from a notebook created by Fred Navruzov and shared on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/frednavruzov/arxiv-exploring-spatial-structure/notebook#Produce-Graph-visualizations-(no-ML)

This will start with exploratory analysis of the network structure and build from there. The goal is to learn more network analysis tools through application to an interesting dataset.
